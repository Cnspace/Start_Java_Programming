Project Title: File Processing Utility

Project Description:
Create a file processing utility that performs various operations on text files. The utility should provide the following features:

File Reader: Read the contents of a text file and display them on the console. Implement this feature using a FileReader and a BufferedReader.
File Writer: Accept user input from the console and write it to a text file. Implement this feature using a FileWriter and a BufferedWriter.
File Copy: Copy the contents of one text file to another. Implement this feature using a FileInputStream and a FileOutputStream, and handle any exceptions that may occur.
File Encryption: Encrypt the contents of a text file using a simple encryption algorithm. Implement this feature by creating a custom encryption class that implements an encryption interface.
File Decryption: Decrypt the contents of an encrypted text file. Implement this feature by creating a custom decryption class that implements the same encryption interface.
File Processing Thread: Implement a multi-threaded file processing feature. Use the Runnable interface to define a file processing task that can be executed concurrently.
Error Handling: Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms using try-catch blocks to handle any exceptions that may occur during file processing operations.
User Interface: Design a simple user interface that allows the user to choose the desired file processing operation and provide the necessary inputs.
The project should be well-organized, with separate classes for each feature and appropriate use of inner classes, interfaces, and input/output streams. Ensure that the code is properly commented and follows best practices for readability and maintainability.

Feel free to customize the project as per your requirements and design preferences. Good luck with your implementation!
